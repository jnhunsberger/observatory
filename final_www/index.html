<h1>Internet Research Observatory</h1>
<h2>School of Information, University of California, Berkeley</h2>

<p>
The Internet Research Observatory is a research project for the spring 2017 <em>Data Science W205 Storing and Retrieving Data</em> course in the <em>Master of Information and Data Science (MIDS)</em> program at UC Berkeley.
</p>
<h3>Research Objective</h3>
<p>
Our research team is investigating the shape, size, and services available on the public Internet over time. This is achieved through periodic scans of the entire IPv4 address space using tools like <a href="http://zmap.io" name="Zmap">Zmap</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan">masscan</a>. Most of our focus is on building the data processing engine that can handle the high-volume traffic that is being generated from these tools during a scan. We also have an interest in performing statistical analysis of the data we collect over the course of our scans.
</p>
<p>
This research is largely modeled after the University of Michigan team who built zmap. We are using this scanning engine to collect publicly available information about hosts on the internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>NOTE: We are not performing reconnaissance for penetration testing activities.</strong>
